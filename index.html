        <p>Fitz Chivalry is the bastard son of the king in waiting, Chivalry Farseer. His mother is unknown, but he was taken away from her at a young age to be raised as a bastard in the Farseer capital city of Buck Keep. He was given over for immediate care by the keeps stable master, Burrich. Burrich had loved Fitz’s father so took to this duty heartily. Sadly, before this point Chivalry had been unable to produce an heir with his current wife, Lady Patience. The drama that unfolded following the discovery of his bastard son caused Chivalry to abdicate his king in waiting position and move away from the capital – never to see his son. Shortly after his seclusion he died under mysterious circumstances.

        Fitz was raised by Burrich and learned all manner of skills in animal husbandry. Over time, Burrich and Fitz developed a father son relationship. As he got older, Fitz started to draw more attention around the capital. Having a bastard roaming about was a precarious thing in those days. The current king, King Shrewd, made quick to secure Fitz loyalty. He made sure Fitz was well taken care of and started to train him in all manner of skills from sword fighting, court manners, map making, and more. His most useful training came in the form of his training in assassination and magic. For you see, Fitz was particularly skilled in the Skill (this settings magic). It allows one’s wielder to reach into the mind of other people and influence them. Combine that with his quick wits makes for an able assassin.

        So, Fitz is now loyal to King Shrewd and does whatever he must to protect him, the royal family, his friends, and the kingdom.</p>
