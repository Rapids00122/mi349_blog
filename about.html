    <p>My name is Richard Ford, and I was born on March 17th, 2001, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I was raised solely by my mother and lived with my 3 other siblings. I have always been into computers, gaming, and fantasy. I remember racing my brother home from school every day so I could be the first one to get on the Xbox in our basement (I usually won). Ever since I was young, I have always taken apart computers and put them back together. I just like to know how things work.</p>
    <p>When I came to college at the age of 19, I thought I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I came into college doing computer science hoping to come out with a well-paying job after I graduated. But, shortly after starting I realized I was totally lost. I didn’t enjoy anything I was doing. I couldn't find any motivation to continue with my life. Am I just going to work 40+hrs a week every week just so I can get a few years of retirement after my body is already tired? Is that all there is to work for? Is this really the purpose of existing?</p>
    <p>We live in a world of no reason with a mind that reasons. It’s a horrible paradox. We are stuck seeking something we can’t ever find. We either fill that void with something that tells us we do have a purpose for existing, or we don’t think about it too much. We continue with daily activities trying to silence that inner monologue that seeks to drown us in questions of, ‘why?’. </p>
    <p>I have resolved to force myself to trudge on, nonetheless. I continue to push that rock up the never-ending hill despite our purposelessness. I struggle against the emptiness of it all even though it means nothing. I accept that fact. I embrace it. Nothing I do will have any effect, but I trudge on to spite the universe that doesn’t care if I exist or die. I attempt to make a castle even as the sand continues to fall between my fingers. </p>
    <p>I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.</p>
